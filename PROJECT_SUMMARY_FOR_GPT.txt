MAIN FEATURES (33+ FEATURES)
================================================================================

1. AUTOMATED TIMETABLE GENERATION
   - One-click timetable generation
   - Constraint-based scheduling using backtracking algorithm
   - Genetic algorithm for optimization
   - Handles complex constraints automatically
   - Multi-objective optimization (minimize conflicts, balance workload)

2. FACULTY WORKLOAD OPTIMIZATION
   - Automatic load balancing across faculty
   - Respects maximum workload limits (18 hours/week)
   - Fair distribution of courses and time slots
   - Workload analytics and visualization
   - Prevents overloading or underutilization

3. DYNAMIC RESCHEDULING SYSTEM (3 MODES)
   
   A. PUBLIC HOLIDAY RESCHEDULING
      - Mark any day as public holiday
      - Automatically reschedules all classes on that day
      - Finds alternative slots in same week (preferred)
      - Maintains workload balance
   
   B. FACULTY LEAVE MANAGEMENT
      - Two-tier approach:
        1. Find substitute faculty (same course, available, workload check)
        2. Reschedule classes if no substitute available
      - Validates all constraints
      - Ranks alternatives by suitability
   
   C. ROOM UNAVAILABILITY MANAGEMENT
      - Two-tier approach:
        1. Find alternative rooms (matching type, capacity, availability)
