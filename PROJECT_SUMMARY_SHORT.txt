AUTOMATED TIMETABLE SCHEDULING SYSTEM - QUICK SUMMARY

PROJECT: Automated Timetable Scheduling and Faculty Workload Optimization System

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)

MAIN FEATURES (33+ total):

1. AUTOMATED TIMETABLE GENERATION
   - One-click generation with constraint satisfaction
   - Uses backtracking + genetic algorithms
   - Optimizes faculty workload and resource utilization

2. FACULTY WORKLOAD OPTIMIZATION
   - Automatic load balancing (max 18 hours/week)
   - Fair distribution across faculty
   - Workload analytics and visualization

3. DYNAMIC RESCHEDULING (3 modes)
   - Public Holiday: Reschedule all classes on a holiday
   - Faculty Leave: Find substitute or reschedule classes
   - Room Unavailable: Find alternative room or reschedule

4. CONFLICT DETECTION & RESOLUTION
   - Real-time detection (faculty/room/section conflicts)
   - Automatic resolution during generation
   - Comprehensive conflict reports

5. DATA MANAGEMENT (6 modules)
   - Faculty, Course, Room, Section, Timeslot, Availability
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Import/Export capabilities

6. MULTIPLE VIEW MODES
   - Faculty-wise, Room-wise, Section-wise, Day-wise views
   - Export to PDF/Excel
   - Print-friendly formats

7. MODERN UI
   - Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
   - Dark mode support
   - Dropdown selectors (no manual ID entry)
   - Real-time validation

8. ROBUST BACKEND
   - RESTful API (9 endpoints)
   - MongoDB transactions
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Performance optimization

ALGORITHMS:
- Backtracking for constraint satisfaction
- Genetic algorithm for optimization
- Constraint-based search for rescheduling

CONSTRAINTS HANDLED:
- Faculty availability and workload limits
- Room capacity and type matching
- Section schedule conflicts
- Time slot preferences

KEY BENEFITS:
- Saves hours of manual scheduling work
- Eliminates scheduling errors
- Handles real-world disruptions automatically
- Optimizes resource utilization
- Professional timetable presentation

STATISTICS:
- 33+ Major Features
- 9 API Endpoints
- 7 Database Collections
- 3 Rescheduling Modes
- 2 Optimization Algorithms
